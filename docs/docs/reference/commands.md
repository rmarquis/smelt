## Shell Escape

Prefix with `!` to run a shell command directly, without going through the
agent. Output appears inline in the conversation.

```
!git status
!cargo test
```

Shell escapes also work while the agent is running.

## Custom Commands

Create `.md` files in `~/.config/smelt/commands/` and they become slash
commands. See the
[Customization guide](../guide/customization.md#custom-commands) for an example.

- **Inline**: `` !`command` `` — output replaces the backtick expression
- **Fenced**: ` ```! ` code block — output replaces the block
- **Escape**: `` \!`command` `` — prevents execution
