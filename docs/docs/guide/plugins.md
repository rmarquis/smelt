# Plugin Authoring

smelt's runtime exposes a Lua API on the global `smelt` table — register slash
commands, react to lifecycle events, paint extmarks, drive the engine, add
custom tools, and so on. Plugins are plain Lua files loaded from
`~/.config/smelt/init.lua` (or `require`d from there).

The full surface lives in the [Lua API reference](../reference/api/index.md);
this page walks through the workflow and patterns for writing plugins against
it.

## Anatomy of a plugin

A plugin is just a Lua module. There is no manifest, no register-yourself call,
and no init hook. Top-level statements run when the file is `require`d, so
that's where you wire your behaviour up.

```lua
-- ~/.config/smelt/plugins/hello.lua
smelt.cmd.register("hello", function(arg)
  smelt.notify("hello, " .. (arg ~= "" and arg or "world"))
end, { desc = "greet someone" })

return {}
```

Load it from `init.lua`:

```lua
require("smelt.plugins.hello") -- ships in runtime/
require("hello")               -- yours, under ~/.config/smelt/
```

For a real walkthrough, the bundled plugins under
[`runtime/lua/smelt/plugins/`](https://github.com/leonardcser/smelt/tree/main/runtime/lua/smelt/plugins)
are the canonical examples — every pattern below comes straight from them.

## Hot reload

Edit any Lua file, then press `F5` or run `/reload`. Your config re-runs from
scratch; the current transcript and agent state stay put. Errors land in
`/messages`. Changes to
[`early.lua`](customization.md#early-phase-config) need a real restart.

Reload also refreshes the on-disk inputs that feed the agent's system prompt
and tool surface, not just Lua:

- `AGENTS.md` (global `~/.config/smelt/AGENTS.md` plus the nearest project
  copy) is re-read.
- Every `SKILL.md` under `~/.config/smelt/skills/` and `.smelt/skills/` is
  rescanned, so new skills, renamed skills, and edits to descriptions or
  bodies all show up on the next turn.
- MCP servers declared with `smelt.mcp.register` are reconciled: new
  registrations spawn, removed registrations stop, and servers whose
  config changed are restarted. Pending tool calls finish on the old
  connection.
- `--system-prompt <file>`, when the flag pointed at a file path, is
  re-read from disk.

Set `smelt.settings.auto_reload = true` to skip the manual F5: smelt watches
`~/.config/smelt/`, `.smelt/`, the nearest `AGENTS.md`, and the
`--system-prompt` file (if any), debounces a 250 ms window, then runs `/reload`
for you. Edits that land while an agent turn is running or a modal dialog is
open are deferred to the next quiet window.

### Surviving reload smoothly

Module bodies run with the host pointer live on every Lua-context bring-up —
both cold start and `/reload`. Three pieces compose into "my UI keeps the
same position / focus / content when the user reloads my plugin":

1. **`smelt.state(name)`** — JSON-shaped table that survives `/reload` (not
   restart). Persist your `is_open` / cursor / variant index here.
2. **`opts.name = "..."`** on `smelt.overlay.new`, `smelt.win.new`,
   `smelt.buf.new`, and `smelt.paint.register` — opts the resource into
   hot-reload survival. The Rust-side structure stays in place; re-passing
   the same name on re-open swaps the layout / closure / contents
   atomically. Anonymous (no-name) resources get reaped each reload.
3. **Module-body re-open** — at the bottom of your file, check the state
   flag and re-call your `open()`. On cold start `is_open` is false, so
   it's a no-op; after `/reload` it's true, so `open()` re-runs and finds
   the named overlay / paint slot already there, just updating closures.

The canonical example is
[`runtime/lua/smelt/examples/banner_picker.lua`](https://github.com/leonardcser/smelt/blob/main/runtime/lua/smelt/examples/banner_picker.lua):

```lua
local function open()
  if STATE then return end
  STATE = {}
  STATE.buf     = smelt.buf.new   ({ name = "myplugin.buf" })
  STATE.win     = smelt.win.new   (STATE.buf, { name = "myplugin.win" })
  STATE.paint   = smelt.paint.register(paint_fn, { name = "myplugin.paint" })
  STATE.overlay = smelt.overlay.new({ name = "myplugin", layout = ... })
  persist().is_open = true
end

-- module body — runs on every Lua-context bring-up.
if persist().is_open then open() end
```

Paint leaves can also receive pointer events directly (`press`, `release`,
`drag`), which is useful for canvas-like overlays that should not be forced
through a buffer-backed window. The leaf that owned the `press` keeps
receiving `drag` and `release` even if the pointer drifts outside its rect:

```lua
local paint = smelt.paint.register(draw_fn, { name = "myplugin.paint" })
paint:on("press",   function(ev) smelt.notify("down @ "..ev.row..","..ev.col) end)
paint:on("drag",    function(ev) ... end)
paint:on("release", function(ev) ... end)
```

Use `smelt.lifecycle.on_ready(fn)` only when you need code that fires
*after* every bring-up's plugin pass completes (cell subscriptions,
deferred wiring). The hook fires with `ctx = { kind = "launch" |
"reload" }` so launch-only handlers can early-return on
`ctx.kind ~= "launch"`.

## Bundled plugins

| Plugin | Autoloaded | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compact` | yes | Owns `/compact` and post-turn auto-compaction (uses `smelt.engine.ask_with_trim`, drives the prompt top-bar working indicator via `smelt.work.busy`) |
| `esc_chord` | yes | `<Esc><Esc>` to cancel `/compact` or rewind a turn |
| `debug_panel` | yes | F3 overlay with resolved model config, context tokens, and pricing |
| `perf_panel` | yes | F12 overlay with live duration percentiles |
| `predict` | yes | After each turn, predicts your next message and shows it as ghost text |
| `scroll_pills` | yes | While the transcript is scrolled away from the tail, shows two click-only overlays — a "↓ jump to bottom" pill above the prompt and a one-row "jump to next message" pill at the top of the terminal |
| `title` | yes | After each turn, generates a session title + slug if one isn't set |
| `background_commands` | **opt-in** (experimental) | Adds `run_in_background` to `bash`, plus `read_process_output`, `stop_process`, and `/ps` |
| `plan_mode` | **opt-in** | Wires up plan mode — registers `exit_plan_mode` and injects the plan-mode system prompt |

To enable an opt-in plugin, `require` it from `~/.config/smelt/init.lua`:

```lua
require("smelt.plugins.background_commands")
require("smelt.plugins.plan_mode")
```

`background_commands` is **experimental** — the background-process model is
still evolving and the tool surface (`run_in_background`, `read_process_output`,
`stop_process`) may change. Without `plan_mode` enabled, switching to plan mode
has no effect on the agent.

## Host vs UiHost

Bindings are tagged with one of two tiers. The
[Lua API index](../reference/api/index.md) groups namespaces by tier and each
per-namespace page calls it out in the header.

- **Host** — works everywhere, including headless mode (`smelt --headless`).
  Examples: `smelt.fs`, `smelt.http`, `smelt.process`, `smelt.cell`,
  `smelt.tools`.
- **UiHost** — requires a live terminal UI. Calling a UiHost function from
  headless mode raises. Examples: `smelt.win`, `smelt.buf`, `smelt.theme`,
  `smelt.notify`, `smelt.statusline`, `smelt.keymap`.

The split matters because the same plugin can run in a TUI session and in a
CI script (`smelt --headless`). Keeping UI logic behind a tier check lets you
write one plugin that works everywhere: core logic in Host, presentation
layer in UiHost.

## Slash commands

`smelt.cmd.register` adds a `/name` command. The handler receives the argument
string (everything after `/name `, possibly empty); `opts` covers description,
busy-state policy, and visibility.

```lua
smelt.cmd.register("ps", function(_arg)
  -- ...
end, {
  desc            = "manage background processes",
  while_busy      = true,   -- callable while an agent turn is running (default)
  queue_when_busy = false,  -- reject vs queue when busy
  hidden          = false,  -- skip /help and the picker
})
```

Use `smelt.cmd.run("name args")` to invoke another command (with or without the
leading slash). Markdown files in `~/.config/smelt/commands/` register
automatically — see [Custom Commands](customization.md#custom-commands) for
that path.

## Lifecycle events

`smelt.cell(name):subscribe(handler)` subscribes to runtime cells — agent
turns, session load, mode changes, tool start/end, and so on. Some carry a
payload, some are bare signals. `:subscribe` returns a `Reg` whose `:remove()`
drops the subscription. The full list is the `smelt.cell.Name` alias in
[`_types.lua`](https://github.com/leonardcser/smelt/blob/main/runtime/lua/smelt/_meta/_types.lua);
common ones:

| Event | Payload | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session_started` | — | A session has been loaded |
| `turn_start` | — | The agent dispatched a turn |
| `turn_end` | `{ cancelled }` | Turn complete (or interrupted) |
| `tool_start` | `{ tool, args }` | A tool call began |
| `tool_end` | `{ tool, is_error, elapsed_ms }` | A tool call finished |
| `agent_mode` | `"normal"|"plan"|"apply"|"yolo"` | Agent mode changed |
| `input_submit` | `{ text }` | User submitted a message |
| `shutdown` | — | App is about to quit |

```lua
smelt.cell("turn_end"):subscribe(function(payload)
  if payload.cancelled then return end
  -- ... e.g. kick off a prediction call
end)

smelt.cell("agent_mode"):subscribe(function(mode)
  if mode == "plan" then activate() else deactivate() end
end)
```

You can also declare your own cells with `smelt.cell.new("my_plugin:state",
initial)` and broadcast updates with `smelt.cell("my_plugin:state"):set(value)`.

## Keymaps

`smelt.keymap.set(mode, chord, handler)`. The mode is `"n"`, `"i"`, `"v"`, or
`""` for any mode; handlers receive a context table.

```lua
smelt.keymap.set("n", "<C-y>", function()
  local where = smelt.focus()
  local text  = where == "transcript" and smelt.transcript.text() or smelt.prompt.text()
  smelt.clipboard.write(text)
end)

smelt.keymap.set("", "<Esc><Esc>", function(ctx)
  if ctx.vim_mode_at_chord_start == "insert" then
    -- ...
  end
  -- returning `false` lets the chord fall through to the next binding
end)
```

Per-window bindings (transcript-only, picker-only, etc.) go through
`win:key(chord, handler)`, which returns a `Reg` whose `:remove()` undoes
the binding.

## Window events and marks

Plugins that paint into existing buffers subscribe to per-window events and
draw with marks scoped to a namespace they own. The pattern is:

```lua
local prompt = smelt.prompt.win()
local ns     = smelt.ns("my_plugin")

prompt:on("text_changed", function()
  local buf = prompt:buf()
  if not buf then return end
  buf:clear_ns(ns):mark(ns, 1, 0, {
    end_col  = 999,
    hl_group = "DiagnosticHint",
    priority = 200,
  })
end)
```

Both `"text_changed"` and the `mark` opts table are type-checked: an unknown
event name or a typo'd field surfaces as a diagnostic in your editor before
the plugin ever runs.

## Floating windows and overlays

For overlays that own their own buffer and rect — picker panels, perf HUDs,
side docks — open a buffer, attach it to a window, then mount that window in
an overlay:

```lua
local buf = smelt.buf.new()
local win = smelt.win.new(buf, { focusable = false })

smelt.overlay.new({
  title     = { { text = " perf ", bold = true } },
  anchor    = "screen_at",
  corner    = "ne",
  width     = 44,           -- cells
  height    = 14,           -- cells
  modal     = false,
  draggable = true,
  layout    = smelt.ui.layout.leaf(win),
})
```

Overlay sizing is two orthogonal concepts:

- **Anchor** — where the overlay lives. Valid values:
  - `"dock_bottom"` (default) — docked above the statusline.
  - `"dock_top"` / `"dock_left"` / `"dock_right"` — docked to the named
    edge. All dock anchors reserve the bottom statusline row.
  - `"center"` — centered on the screen.
  - `"screen_at"` — absolute position; pair with `corner` + `row` + `col`.
  - `"win"` — attached to another window; pair with `target` (win id),
    `attach` (corner), and `row_offset` / `col_offset`.
- **Size** — `width` / `height` set a fixed extent; `max_width` /
  `max_height` shrink-to-fit with a cap. Setting both fixed and max on the
  same axis is an error. Each value accepts:
  - an integer (cells),
  - a `"N%"` string (percent of the anchor's available extent on that axis),
  - `"fill"` (the entire available extent).

Anchor defaults: `dock_bottom` / `dock_top` are full-width × 60% tall;
`dock_left` / `dock_right` are 30% wide × full-height; `center` is 70% × 60%;
`screen_at` / `win` default to 60×20 cells.

For modal dialogs (a markdown panel + an option list + a free-text input, etc.)
`smelt.dialog.open` is the higher-level surface — it returns the result of
the user's choice. The bundled dialogs in
[`runtime/lua/smelt/dialogs/`](https://github.com/leonardcser/smelt/tree/main/runtime/lua/smelt/dialogs)
(`confirm`, `permissions`, `resume`, `rewind`) are the reference implementations.

Dialog height has two modes:

- `height = "N%"` (or cells, or `"fill"`) — fixed size. Default `"60%"`. Use
  this when the body should always fill the dock regardless of content size.
- `max_height = "N%"` (or cells, or `"fill"`) — dialog shrinks to fit its
  content, capped at this value. Panels with no explicit `height` default to
  `"fit"` so a single-panel dialog actually shrinks; longer content triggers
  the panel's scrollbar at the cap. Setting both `height` and `max_height` is
  an error.

## Tasks: tool calls, dialogs, sleeps

Anything that yields — `smelt.sleep`, `smelt.dialog.open`,
`smelt.picker.open`, `smelt.tools.call`, `smelt.task.wait` — must run inside
a task-yielding context. Yielding keeps the TUI responsive: while your
coroutine waits for a dialog answer or a slow HTTP response, the main thread
continues rendering and handling input. There are two contexts:

1. **Inside `tool.execute`** — every plugin tool already runs on a coroutine.
2. **Wrapped in `smelt.spawn(fn)`** — fire-and-forget coroutine for everything
   else (a slash-command handler that opens a dialog, a timer callback that
   parks on a tool call, etc.).

```lua
smelt.cmd.register("ps", function()
  smelt.spawn(function()
    local result = smelt.dialog.open({ ... })
    if result.action == "approve" then ... end
  end)
end)
```

Calling `smelt.sleep` from outside a yielding context raises immediately —
that's how you tell which side of the line you're on.

`smelt.spawn(fn)` returns a `Reg` whose `:remove()` cancels the coroutine —
any in-flight `smelt.sleep` / `smelt.task.wait` raises `cancelled` and the
task unwinds. When a plugin owns several reactive subscriptions, combine
them with `smelt.reg.compose(...)` and return one handle:

```lua
return smelt.reg.compose(
  smelt.win.cur():key("n", "<leader>x", handler),
  smelt.fs.watch(path, on_change),
  smelt.timer.every(1000, tick)
)
```

`smelt.reg.new(fn)` wraps an arbitrary teardown function as a `Reg` for
cases that need custom cleanup logic.

## Concurrency combinators

`smelt.task.timeout`, `smelt.task.race`, and `smelt.task.all` compose
multiple coroutines through `smelt.spawn` + `smelt.task.external`. All
require a yielding context.

```lua
-- Bound a yielding op with a deadline.
local out, err = smelt.task.timeout(2000, function()
  return smelt.process.run("slow-command", {})
end)
if err == "timeout" then ... end

-- First to finish wins; losers are cancelled.
local winner = smelt.task.race(
  function() return smelt.fs.read_async("/etc/hostname") end,
  function() smelt.sleep(500); return "fallback" end
)
print(winner.index, winner.result)

-- Wait for everything; results stay in input order.
local results = smelt.task.all(
  function() return smelt.fs.read_async("a.txt") end,
  function() return smelt.fs.read_async("b.txt") end
)
```

## Plugin state

`smelt.state(name)` returns an ephemeral table scoped to `name`. Survives
`/reload` but not a restart. Use it for live UI state — whether a panel is
open, the current scroll position, or a cache that can be rebuilt. Plugins
removed since the last load have their slots swept automatically.

```lua
local s = smelt.state("my_plugin")
s.counter = (s.counter or 0) + 1
```

`smelt.state.persistent(name)` returns a JSON-backed wrapper that writes
through to `[REDACTED:secret]`. Use it for user preferences or data that
must survive restarts. Top-level
assignments are debounced and auto-saved; nested mutations need an
explicit `:save()`.

```lua
local s = smelt.state.persistent("recent_files")
s.last_opened = "/path/to/file"   -- debounced auto-save
table.insert(s.history or {}, "another"); s.save()   -- nested → manual save
```

## Filesystem watching

`smelt.fs.watch(path, handler, opts?)` calls `handler(event)` for each
filesystem change under `path`. `event = { kind, detail?, paths }`:

- `kind` — `"create" | "modify" | "remove" | "rename" | "access" | "other" | "any"`.
- `detail` — finer-grained sub-kind when notify reports one. Examples:
  `kind = "create"` → `detail = "file" | "folder"`;
  `kind = "rename"` → `detail = "from" | "to" | "both"`;
  `kind = "modify"` → `detail = "data" | "metadata"`.
- `paths` — list of affected paths.

Set `opts.recursive = false` to watch only direct children. Returns a `Reg`:

```lua
local reg = smelt.fs.watch(vim.fn.getcwd(), function(ev)
  for _, p in ipairs(ev.paths) do
    smelt.log.info(ev.kind .. " " .. p)
  end
end)
-- later: reg:remove()
```

## Off-thread filesystem, process, and grep I/O

`smelt.process.run` and `smelt.grep.run` yield the calling coroutine
through the task runtime instead of blocking the main loop; they must
run inside `smelt.spawn(fn)` or a `tool.execute` body. Off-thread I/O
keeps the TUI responsive while a large file is read or a long command
runs — the agent can still stream tokens and you can still scroll and
type. The same is true for the explicit `smelt.fs.read_async` /
`smelt.fs.write_async` variants when reading or writing large files.
`smelt.fs.read` / `smelt.fs.write` stay synchronous and are fine for
small config-time reads:

```lua
smelt.spawn(function()
  local content, err = smelt.fs.read_async("/path/to/big.json")
  if not content then return io.stderr:write(err) end
  local ok = smelt.fs.write_async("/tmp/out", transform(content))

  local out = smelt.process.run("ripgrep", { "TODO", "." })
  if out then print(out.stdout) end

  local matches = smelt.grep.run("TODO", ".", { line_numbers = true })
  if matches then print(matches.stdout) end
end)
```

**Cancellation semantics.** When the calling coroutine is cancelled
(`smelt.task.timeout` deadline, `smelt.task.race` loser, or
`:remove()` on the spawn Reg), every yielding API raises `cancelled`
and unwinds. The underlying work differs by kind:

- `smelt.process.run` — the child's process group receives SIGTERM;
  the future resolves once the kill completes.
- `smelt.grep.run` — the `rg` child receives SIGKILL and the future
  resolves once `wait()` returns.
- `smelt.fs.read_async` / `smelt.fs.write_async` — the std::fs call
  can't be interrupted mid-syscall, so the worker thread runs to
  completion and the result is discarded. Bounded waste (file-size
  dependent); no external side effects leak.
- `smelt.sleep` / `smelt.task.wait` — instantaneous.

## Pickers

`smelt.picker.fuzzy(opts)` is the high-level entry point for choose-one
prompts. Items can be plain strings or `{ label, description, ansi_color,
search_terms }` records; ranking is delegated to `smelt.fuzzy.rank`.
Returns `{ index, item, action }` on accept or `nil` on dismiss.

```lua
smelt.spawn(function()
  local choice = smelt.picker.fuzzy({
    items = { "first", "second", "third" },
    placeholder = "pick one",
  })
  if choice then smelt.log.info("picked " .. choice.item.label) end
end)
```

## Custom tools

`smelt.tools.register({ name, execute, ... })` exposes a tool to the model.
Only `name` and `execute` are required; the rest of `smelt.tools.ToolDef` is
optional metadata that controls rendering, approvals, and per-mode behaviour.

```lua
smelt.tools.register({
  name        = "exit_plan_mode",
  description = "Signal that planning is complete and ready for user approval.",
  modes       = { "plan" },           -- only registered in plan mode
  parameters  = {
    type = "object",
    properties = {
      plan_summary = { type = "string", description = "..." },
    },
    required = { "plan_summary" },
  },
  permission_defaults = { normal = "allow", plan = "allow" },
  summary  = function(_args) return "plan ready" end,
  render   = function(args, output, width, buf)
    smelt.render.markdown(buf, args.plan_summary or "")
  end,
  execute  = function(args)
    local result = smelt.dialog.open({ ... }) -- yields, allowed inside execute
    if result.action ~= "approve" then
      return { content = "Plan not approved", is_error = true }
    end
    return "ok"
  end,
})
```

Return either a plain string (success) or `{ content, is_error }`. From inside
`execute` you can also:

- **Chain another tool** with `smelt.tools.call("name", args, parent_call_id)`
  — yields until the child resolves and returns its `{ content, is_error }`.
- **Park on user input** with `smelt.task.wait(id)`, resumed later by
  `smelt.task.resume(id, value)` from a key handler, event subscriber, etc.

Set `override = true` to replace a built-in tool of the same name (this is how
`background_commands.lua` adds `run_in_background` to `bash`). Use
`smelt.tools.unregister(name)` to take it back out.

For tool-authoring conventions (parameter shape, `summary`,
`approval_patterns`, `preflight`, `paths_for_workspace`), the implementations
under [`runtime/lua/smelt/tools/`](https://github.com/leonardcser/smelt/tree/main/runtime/lua/smelt/tools)
are the source of truth.

## Statusline sources

Plugins can append segments to the statusline. The handler is called once per
refresh with the current snapshot and returns one segment or a list of
segments:

```lua
smelt.statusline.register("clock", function(_snap)
  return { text = os.date(" %H:%M "), fg = 245, priority = 2 }
end, { align = "right" })
```

`smelt.statusline.unregister(name)` removes it. Built-in segments (slug, vim
mode, model, cost, position) keep rendering alongside whatever you add.

## String-literal aliases

String parameters typed as `smelt.<namespace>.<Name>` accept a closed set of
labels — the IDE shows them in autocomplete and rejects typos. Closed aliases
require canonical names only: `smelt.vim.set_mode("normal")` works,
`smelt.vim.set_mode("n")` does not (short forms `"n"`, `"i"`, `"v"`, `"V"`,
and PascalCase variants like `"Insert"` are not accepted). Open aliases (e.g.
[`smelt.cell.Name`](../reference/api/types.md#smeltcellname)) keep accepting
any string and just expose well-known names as completion hints.
