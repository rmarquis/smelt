# Usage

## The Basics

The agent streams its response and may call tools along the way.

- `Ctrl+J` or `Shift+Enter` inserts a newline (for multi-line messages)
- `Ctrl+R` fuzzy-searches your input history
- `Ctrl+X Ctrl+E` opens your `$EDITOR` for longer messages
- `Ctrl+C` clears the input, cancels the agent, or quits (context-dependent)
- `?` (with empty input) opens the help dialog

## Modes

The agent has four modes, each with different permission defaults. Press
`Shift+Tab` to cycle through them.

| Mode       | What it does                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Normal** | Default. Asks before editing files or running commands. Read tools are auto-allowed.                                              |
| **Plan**   | Read-only. The agent produces a plan and calls `exit_plan_mode` when done. You review the summary and approve to switch to Apply. Requires the [`plan_mode` plugin](plugins.md#bundled-plugins). |
| **Apply**  | File edits are auto-approved. Bash still asks.                                                                                    |
| **Yolo**   | Everything auto-approved. You can still deny specific patterns via config.                                                        |

The current mode is shown in the status bar. Set the starting mode with
`--mode`, and customize which modes appear in the cycle with `--mode-cycle`.

See [Permissions Reference](../reference/permissions.md) for the full default
matrix.

## Reasoning Effort

Press `Ctrl+T` to cycle through reasoning levels (`off`, `low`, `medium`,
`high`, `max`), or use `/reasoning` (with or without an argument) to pick one
directly. Set the starting level with `--reasoning-effort`, and configure which
levels appear in the cycle with `--reasoning-cycle`.

## Tools

The agent can read files, edit code, run shell commands, fetch URLs, and more.
When a tool requires permission, a **confirm dialog** appears showing what the
tool wants to do. You can approve once, for the session, or for the workspace.
Press `Tab` to attach an optional message to your approval.

See [Tools Reference](../reference/tools.md) for the full list and
[Permissions](../reference/permissions.md) for details on approval scopes.

## File References

Type `@` followed by a path to attach file contents to your message. A fuzzy
file picker opens automatically:

```
explain @src/main.rs
```

Multiple `@` references work in the same message. Attaching the same file twice
won't double-send it.

## Shell Escape

Prefix with `!` to run a shell command directly: `!git status`. Output appears
inline in the conversation.

## Pasting

`Cmd+V` pastes from your clipboard — images are attached inline, and multi-line
text is collapsed into a single attachment.

## Message Queuing

While the agent is responding, keep typing. Messages queue up and are sent one
at a time — each queued message becomes its own turn, in order.

- `Enter` on an empty prompt — pop and send the next queued message immediately
- `Esc` — unqueue pending messages so you can edit them
- `Esc Esc` — cancel the agent _and_ unqueue everything

## Sessions

Every conversation is automatically saved after each turn.

Resume from the CLI:

```bash
smelt --resume              # open the session picker
smelt --resume <SESSION_ID> # resume a specific session
```

Or use `/resume` from within the TUI. Use `/fork` to branch the current
conversation into a new session, or `/rewind` (also `Esc Esc` when idle) to
roll back to an earlier turn.

## Compaction

Long conversations eat context. `/compact` replaces older messages with a
condensed summary, freeing space while preserving essential information.

```
/compact keep details about the auth refactor
```

The full transcript remains visible and scrollable — only the model's context
is compacted. A checkpoint marker appears in the transcript where compaction
occurred. Your most recent turns are kept verbatim so the model still sees
recent detail; older turns are summarized away.

Recent detail is retained only while it fits both retention limits:
`smelt.settings.compact_keep_recent_turns` (default `3`) and
`smelt.settings.compact_keep_recent_bytes` (default `40000`). If the retained
tail would exceed the byte budget, Smelt drops whole older turns from the
model-visible tail; the full transcript still stays visible.

When `auto_compact` is enabled (via `/settings`), compaction triggers
automatically before a model request whose active context would cross
`compact_threshold` of the configured context window. After the first provider
usage report, Smelt anchors this check to the provider-reported context size
and adds only messages created locally since the last model response, so the
trigger matches the prompt bar rather than a full-history byte estimate. Press
`Esc Esc` to cancel.

## Vim Mode

Toggle with `/vim` or set `smelt.settings.vim = true` in `init.lua`. Supports
insert, normal, and visual modes. See the
[Keybindings Reference](../reference/keybindings.md#vim-mode) for details.

## Input Stashing

Press `Ctrl+S` to stash your current input and get a blank buffer. Press
`Ctrl+S` again to restore it.

## Input Prediction

After each turn, the agent may suggest your next message as dim **ghost text**.
Press `Tab` to accept it, or just start typing to dismiss. Toggle in `/settings`
→ `input prediction` or set `smelt.settings.show_prediction = false` in
`init.lua`.
