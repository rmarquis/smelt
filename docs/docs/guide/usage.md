# Usage

## The Basics

The agent streams its response and may call tools along the way.

- `Ctrl+J` or `Shift+Enter` inserts a newline (for multi-line messages)
- `Ctrl+R` fuzzy-searches your input history
- `Ctrl+X Ctrl+E` opens your `$EDITOR` for longer messages
- `Ctrl+C` clears the input, cancels the agent, or quits (context-dependent)
- `?` (with empty input) opens the help dialog

## Modes

The agent has four modes, each with different permission defaults. Press
`Shift+Tab` to cycle through them. Modes let you change the agent's
behaviour to match the task: review a risky refactor in Plan mode, speed
through routine edits in Apply mode, or stay hands-off on a trusted
legacy codebase in Yolo mode.

| Mode       | What it does                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Normal** | Default. Asks before editing files or running commands. Read tools are auto-allowed.                                              |
| **Plan**   | Read-only. The agent produces a plan and calls `exit_plan_mode` when done. You review the summary and approve to switch to Apply. Requires the [`plan_mode` plugin](plugins.md#bundled-plugins). |
| **Apply**  | File edits are auto-approved. Bash still asks.                                                                                    |
| **Yolo**   | Everything auto-approved. You can still deny specific patterns via config.                                                        |

The current mode is shown in the status bar. Set the starting mode with
`--mode`, and customize which modes appear in the cycle with `--mode-cycle`.

See [Permissions Reference](../reference/permissions.md) for the full default
matrix.

## Reasoning Effort

Press `Ctrl+T` to cycle through reasoning levels (`off`, `low`, `medium`,
`high`, `max`). Lower levels are faster and cheaper; use them for routine
questions. Higher levels give the agent more compute for architecture
reviews, complex refactors, or debugging tangled bugs. Set the starting
level with `--reasoning-effort`, and configure which levels appear in the
cycle with `--reasoning-cycle`.

## Tools

The agent can read files, edit code, run shell commands, fetch URLs, and more.
When a tool requires permission, a **confirm dialog** appears showing what the
tool wants to do. You can approve once, for the session, or for the workspace.
Session and workspace approvals save you from repeatedly confirming the same
safe operation — for example, allowing every `git status` call in a repo you
trust. Press `Tab` to attach an optional message to your approval.

See [Tools Reference](../reference/tools.md) for the full list and
[Permissions](../reference/permissions.md) for details on approval scopes.

## File References

Type `@` followed by a path to attach file contents to your message. A fuzzy
file picker opens automatically:

```
explain @src/main.rs
```

`@` references let you point the agent at exactly the code you mean without
copy-pasting into the prompt. Multiple `@` references work in the same message.
Attaching the same file twice won't double-send it.

## Shell Escape

Prefix with `!` to run a shell command directly: `!git status`. Output appears
inline in the conversation. This is useful for quick checks — verifying test
output, reading a config value — without bloating the agent's context window
with a full tool call.

## Pasting

`Cmd+V` pastes from your clipboard — images are attached inline, and multi-line
text is collapsed into a single attachment. Pasting images is handy for sharing
screenshots of UI bugs, diagrams, or design mock-ups without leaving the
terminal.

## Message Queuing

While the agent is responding, keep typing. Messages queue up and are sent one
at a time — each queued message becomes its own turn, in order. This lets you
fire off follow-up questions or corrections as soon as you think of them,
instead of waiting for the current response to finish.

- `Enter` on an empty prompt — pop and send the next queued message immediately
- `Esc` — unqueue pending messages so you can edit them
- `Esc Esc` — cancel the agent _and_ unqueue everything

## Sessions

Every conversation is automatically saved after each turn. Sessions let you
maintain parallel workstreams — one for the frontend refactor, another for the
API migration — and pick up exactly where you left off days later without
re-explaining the codebase.

Resume from the CLI:

```bash
smelt --resume              # open the session picker
smelt --resume <SESSION_ID> # resume a specific session
```

Or use `/resume` from within the TUI. Use `/fork` to branch the current
conversation into a new session, or `/rewind` (also `Esc Esc` when idle) to
roll back to an earlier turn.

## Compaction

Long conversations eat context. `/compact` replaces older messages with a
condensed summary, freeing space while preserving essential information.

```
/compact keep details about the auth refactor
```

The full transcript remains visible and scrollable — only the model's context
is compacted. A checkpoint marker appears in the transcript where compaction
occurred. Your most recent turns are kept verbatim so the model still sees
recent detail; older turns are summarized away.

Recent detail is retained only while it fits both retention limits:
`smelt.settings.compact_keep_recent_turns` (default `3`) and
`smelt.settings.compact_keep_recent_bytes` (default `40000`). If the retained
tail would exceed the byte budget, Smelt drops whole older turns from the
model-visible tail; the full transcript still stays visible.

When `auto_compact` is enabled (via `/settings`), compaction triggers
automatically before a model request whose active context would cross
`compact_threshold` of the configured context window. After the first provider
usage report, Smelt anchors this check to the provider-reported context size
and adds only messages created locally since the last model response, so the
trigger matches the prompt bar rather than a full-history byte estimate. Press
`Esc Esc` to cancel.

## Vim Mode

Toggle with `/vim` or set `smelt.settings.vim = true` in `init.lua`. Supports
insert, normal, and visual modes. If you already live in Vim, this keeps your
muscle memory intact — navigate the transcript, edit the prompt, and select
text with the same chords you use in your editor. See the
[Keybindings Reference](../reference/keybindings.md#vim-mode) for details.

## Input Stashing

Press `Ctrl+S` to stash your current input and get a blank buffer. Press
`Ctrl+S` again to restore it. Stashing is useful when you are halfway through
a long prompt and need to ask a quick side question without losing your draft.

## Input Prediction

After each turn, the agent may suggest your next message as dim **ghost text**.
Press `Tab` to accept it, or just start typing to dismiss. Prediction saves
keystrokes on repetitive follow-ups — "also add tests", "fix the lint errors",
and so on. Toggle in `/settings` → `input prediction` or set
`smelt.settings.show_prediction = false` in `init.lua`.
